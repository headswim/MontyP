# montyp-simulator

Project Name
MontyP

Goal
Create a visual play tester for the Monty Hall Problem.

Requirements

Layout
Two pillars, each with 5 columns.
Each pillar represents 100 iterations of a Monty Hall strategy.
Each cell in the pillars represents one iteration.
Running Tally

Display a running tally of the number of wins for each pillar above them.
Game Rules
Three options: A, B, and C (options donâ€™t need to be named explicitly).
Randomly choose one of the 3 options.
Remove one incorrect option from the remaining two (if both are incorrect, remove one at random).
Each pillar represents a player choosing a strategy.

Outcomes
Each cell has a binary outcome: right (correct) or wrong.
Correct plays turn the cell green and increment the wins tally.

Strategies
Both pillars use the same initial strategy: a random first choice.
First Pillar: "Donâ€™t Switch" group, always keeps the initial choice.
Second Pillar: "Switch" group, always switches to the remaining option.

Controls
Add a start button at the top.
The start button resets colors, begins iterating through the 200 plays, assigns wins and losses, and tallies the results. Think of it as a "head-to-head"; i'd like 1 iteration of each calculated "simultaneously" so the iterations proceed at the same pace and finish together

Additional Notes
Ensure the first choice is always random.
Correct plays turn the cell green, incorrect plays do not change the cell color.
